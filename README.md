# Property Listings
Property Listings - An iOS mobile app that displays real estate listings 



Property Listings is a mobile application written in Javascript that displays real estate data. I wrote this application following along with Ray Wenderlich's React Native tutorial. https://www.raywenderlich.com/165140/react-native-tutorial-building-ios-android-apps-javascript. 

I have contributed to the original code by adding a segue to a detail view, where I list details for the selected listing.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

Xcode 8

From React Native Docs
```
Homebrew is the recommended way to install Watchman and Flow.
Install Node.js 4.0 or newer.
Install nvm with its setup instructions here. Then run nvm install node && nvm alias default node, which installs the latest version of Node.js and sets up your terminal so you can run it by typing node. With nvm you can install multiple versions of Node.js and easily switch between them.
New to npm?
brew install watchman. We recommend installing watchman, otherwise you might hit a node file watching bug.
brew install flow, if you want to use flow.
We recommend periodically running brew update && brew upgrade to keep your programs up-to-date.
```
